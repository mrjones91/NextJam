### Description

Play some music, all you have to do is connect the notes. 
Thinking about the connection of notes that allows for the creation of music, I built a player that would allow you to play a tune by connecting the notes you play together into a song.
Choose to play notes sequentially, by skipping a note, playing notes in the same chord or going up an octave. The various connections make your tune earn a higher score depending on the difficulty/length of the connection to the next note.
